    Noise reduction using smoothing and blurring

    Gaussian filtering:
        This blurring technique gives a more natural smoothing result compared to the averaging technique.
        In this filtering, we supply a Gaussian kernel instead of a boxed fixed kernel.
        A Gaussian kernel consists of the height, width, and standard deviations in the X and Y directions.
