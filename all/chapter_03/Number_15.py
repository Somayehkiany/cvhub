    Adaptive Thresholding

    Adaptive thresholding is used to binarize a grayscale image that has a varying degree
    of pixel intensity, and one single threshold value may not be suitable to extract the
    information from the image. In adaptive thresholding, the algorithm determines the
    threshold for a pixel based on a small region around it. This will get us a different
    threshold value for different regions in the same image.
